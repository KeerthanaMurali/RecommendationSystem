# RecommendationSystem

It is an in-class challenge in Kaggle where the dataset is collected from an online social network platform. Here, people interact with others by making friends and posting reviews and ratings for different items. The task here is to recommend each people a set of ten items from the provided user-item list where the recommendations are obtained from the users history of previously purchased items. I tried to accomplish this task using different kinds of "Collaborative Filtering" of "implicit" type of feedback.
